## Complete Conversation Summary
Initial task/request: "Continue. You were in the middle of request:
soul all quary
Avoid repeating steps you've already taken."

You asked to regenerate the code without errors, improve structure, and separate frontend and backend. We clarified and locked decisions:
- Backend: FastAPI only (drop Flask).
- Frontend: simple static HTML/JS.
- API routing: unify under /api/... with backward-compatible aliases for existing routes.
- Deployment: keep local venv + Windows start scripts.

Key solutions implemented:
- Created a clean project split:
  - backend/: unified FastAPI service exposing:
    - Unified endpoints: /api/{platform}/info, /api/{platform}/download, /api/{platform}/download_mp3
    - Backward-compatible aliases: /{platform}/info and /{platform}/download
    - Minimal UI at /ui and health check at /health
  - frontend/: static UI (index.html, style.css, main.js) that calls unified /api endpoints.
- Implemented yt-dlp integration with extractor hints (YouTube android client, skip HLS; language hints for Instagram/TikTok), cookies file support via env, FFmpeg path via env.
- Implemented streaming passthrough that is HEAD-friendly to address prior 405 responses when probing downloads via HEAD.
- Added merged-download logic for video+audio and MP3 extraction via yt-dlp+FFmpeg.
- Preserved simple in-memory caching of info for performance.

- Modified:
  - Minor edits to e:\project\downloader\backend\app\main.py to remove BackgroundTasks() default instantiation in route signatures (potential FastAPI issue).
- No deletions yet; legacy files remain for reference (e.g., social_api.py, fastapi_app.py).

Key technical details and approaches:
- FastAPI app factory pattern (create_app) and app instance exposed via package __init__.py.
- Uvicorn start command uses app-dir to the backend package: uvicorn app:app --app-dir backend/app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001.
- HEAD-friendly downloads: FastAPI GET routes accept HEAD automatically; our passthrough prevalidates via HEAD and sets Content-Length, Accept-Ranges.
- Backward compatibility maintained so existing test script (test_social_api.py) can keep using /{platform}/info and /{platform}/download.
- Environment variables honored: COOKIES_FILE, FFMPEG_LOCATION/FFMPEG_PATH, USER_AGENT, ACCEPT_LANGUAGE.

Issues encountered and resolution steps:
- Port binding conflict (WinError 10048) when relaunching server: resolved by stopping existing python/uvicorn processes and restarting.
- Initial tests (before refactor) showed 405 on HEAD for download probe; addressed by implementing server-side streaming endpoint which is HEAD-friendly by FastAPI semantics.
- After refactor, /health and all endpoints returned 500 Internal Server Error. We removed default BackgroundTasks instances in route signatures (which can cause schema/model generation issues) and restarted, but /health still returned 500. Root cause not yet fully diagnosed; needs traceback capture (e.g., run uvicorn with --reload and check console stack trace or add middleware to log exceptions).

Current status and outcomes:
- Project is reorganized into backend/ and frontend/ with a unified FastAPI backend and static frontend.
- Server starts and listens on 127.0.0.1:8001, but currently /health (and others) return 500. The legacy, pre-refactor server worked for YouTube info earlier, but the unified version needs a quick fix.
- Test runner now shows 500s for all platforms due to the backend 500 issue; once fixed, the HEAD 405 issue should be resolved by our new download route.

Important insights for future work:
- FastAPI route parameters should not instantiate BackgroundTasks() as defaults; use type hints and default None to let FastAPI inject.
- To finalize stability, capture and fix the 500 on /health:
  - Run uvicorn with log level debug to capture exception stack traces.
  - Verify no global code executes network-dependent work at import time (health should be a simple dict).
  - Double-check that from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse is sufficient and that no missing imports exist at runtime.
- Consider adding Dockerfile and CI later for consistent reproducible deployments.
- Keep COOKIES_FILE for Instagram/Facebook/Twitter to improve success rates; many endpoints require auth/cookies.
- Once /health 500 is fixed, rerun test_social_api.py to validate HEAD behavior and overall flow.
