## Complete Conversation Summary
The session began with “run full code,” followed by the request to “regenerate full code without any error and make code full of perfection make all file currect and make seprate file and folder for frontend and backed.” We clarified decisions and locked in:
- FastAPI-only backend (drop Flask).
- Simple static frontend (no build step).
- Unified API under /api/... with backward-compatible legacy routes.
- Keep local venv and Windows start scripts.

We first ran the original service (social_api.py) on http://127.0.0.1:8001 and executed test_social_api.py:
- YouTube info endpoints returned 200 and titles; HEAD probes for downloads returned 405 (expected on many CDNs).
- Other platforms largely returned 400 due to cookies, geo, or extractor issues (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, Pinterest).

Restructuring work:
- Created backend and frontend directories.
- Implemented a unified FastAPI service:
  - File: e:\project\downloader\backend\app\main.py
  - App factory create_app with CORS and endpoints:
    - Unified: /api/{platform}/info, /api/{platform}/download, /api/{platform}/download_mp3
    - Legacy-compatible: /{platform}/info, /{platform}/download
    - Health: /health
    - Minimal UI: /ui
  - Features:
    - yt-dlp integration with extractor hints (YouTube android client, skip HLS).
    - Optional cookies via COOKIES_FILE; FFmpeg path via FFMPEG_LOCATION/FFMPEG_PATH.
    - In-memory cache keyed by URL, 10-minute TTL.
    - HEAD-friendly passthrough streaming to avoid 405s where possible.
    - Video merge path for video+audio; MP3 extraction via postprocessor.
    - Safe filename sanitization.
- Frontend scaffold (static):
  - index.html, style.css, main.js in e:\project\downloader\frontend
  - Detect platform, call /api/{platform}/info, render formats, link to /api/{platform}/download.
- Added a Windows runner:
  - e:\project\downloader\backend\run_backend.ps1 to start uvicorn with the new app.
- Ensured app import:
  - e:\project\downloader\backend\app\__init__.py exports app = create_app().

Issues encountered and handling:
- After refactor, starting the new uvicorn instance succeeded, but /health and all endpoints returned 500. We removed default-constructed BackgroundTasks from function signatures (which can cause runtime issues), restarted, but 500 persisted. We did not capture stack traces from uvicorn logs during this session; openapi.json also returned 500.
- Earlier, with the original social_api.py, tests partially succeeded: YouTube info OK, download HEAD 405 (expected), others 400 due to cookies/extractors.

Current status:
- Project reorganized into backend/frontend with a unified FastAPI backend and simple static frontend.
- Legacy endpoints preserved for compatibility with test_social_api.py.
- Server runs but returns HTTP 500 for /health and others; needs debugging with server logs/tracebacks.

Key technical approaches:
- Centralized yt-dlp options and extractor args.
- HEAD-friendly StreamingResponse passthrough via httpx to mitigate 405.
- Merge/download and MP3 paths implemented with temporary directories and cleanup.
- Simple UI to exercise the API.

Insights for future work:
- Immediately capture uvicorn exception tracebacks to resolve the 500 error (likely an import-time or runtime exception; verify app factory, route signatures, and module imports).
- Add structured logging to the backend and a dev config for debug mode.
- Consider Dockerization later for deployment.
- For better test stability, configure COOKIES_FILE for Instagram/Facebook/Twitter and validate ffmpeg availability.
- Optionally deprecate/remove legacy files (social_api.py, fastapi_app.py) after the new service is verified.
