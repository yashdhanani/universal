## Complete Conversation Summary
You asked to “run full code,” then to regenerate the project “without any error” and split it into separate frontend and backend. After clarifying requirements, we locked in these decisions:
- Backend choice: FastAPI only (drop Flask).
- Frontend approach: simple static HTML/JS.
- API routing: unify under /api/... with backward-compatible aliases to existing routes.
- Deployment: keep local venv + Windows start scripts.

I first validated the existing setup by starting the original FastAPI app (social_api.py) on 127.0.0.1:8001 and running test_social_api.py:
- YouTube info returned 200 with titles; HEAD download probes returned 405 (expected for many CDNs).
- Other platforms mostly failed with 400 due to cookies/geo/extractor limitations (normal for public test URLs).

Then I reorganized the project:
- Created backend and frontend directories.
- Implemented a unified FastAPI application under backend/app that merges the prior capabilities, exposes unified /api/{platform}/... endpoints, and preserves legacy routes (/{platform}/info and /{platform}/download) for compatibility with test_social_api.py.
- Implemented streaming passthrough that is HEAD-friendly (to mitigate 405 issues on HEAD).
- Implemented merge downloads and MP3 extraction using yt-dlp + ffmpeg path from env.
- Added simple in-memory caching, filename sanitization, and CORS for local development origins.
- Added a minimal static UI under frontend/ for quick manual testing.
- Added a PowerShell runner script for the backend.

Files created:
- e:\project\downloader\backend\app\__init__.py
- e:\project\downloader\backend\app\main.py
- e:\project\downloader\backend\run_backend.ps1
- e:\project\downloader\frontend\index.html
- e:\project\downloader\frontend\style.css
- e:\project\downloader\frontend\main.js

Modifications:
- No destructive changes to existing code; legacy files (social_api.py, fastapi_app.py) were left intact for reference.
- test_social_api.py unchanged.

Key technical approaches:
- Consolidated endpoints under /api/{platform}/info, /api/{platform}/download, /api/{platform}/download_mp3.
- Kept legacy aliases /{platform}/info and /{platform}/download to not break existing tests.
- Used httpx for HEAD checks and streaming downloads when possible; fell back to redirect if httpx is absent.
- Avoided instantiating BackgroundTasks in default parameters (changed to None) to prevent FastAPI injection issues.
- Ensured DOWNLOADS directory creation and environment-driven FFmpeg path support.

Issues encountered and handling:
- After starting the new backend (uvicorn app:app with --app-dir backend/app), requests to /health and /openapi.json returned 500 Internal Server Error.
- We adjusted endpoint signatures to avoid default BackgroundTasks() instantiation and fully restarted the server, but /health still returned 500.
- This indicates a remaining internal error (likely an import/path issue, middleware misconfiguration, or a runtime error during route handling or startup) despite Uvicorn showing “Application startup complete.” The next step is to run with debug logs and inspect the exception traceback.

Current status and outcomes:
- Project is reorganized into backend and frontend with a unified FastAPI structure and preserved legacy routes.
- The server process starts successfully under Uvicorn, but endpoints currently respond with HTTP 500; original social_api server worked prior to refactor.
- Tests against the new backend returned 500 for all info endpoints; prior to refactor, YouTube succeeded and others failed as expected due to cookies/extractor.
- HEAD 405 mitigation is implemented in the new code, pending resolution of the 500 error.

Important insights for future work:
- Do not instantiate FastAPI’s BackgroundTasks as default argument values; use None and create when needed.
- Maintain backward compatibility during refactors via explicit alias routes to avoid breaking consumers/tests.
- Add structured logging and exception handlers to capture stack traces; run Uvicorn with --log-level debug.
- Validate app import path when using --app-dir and ensure the module (app) exposes app = create_app() correctly.
- Consider unit testing with FastAPI’s TestClient to catch 500s early.
- Keep COOKIES_FILE and FFmpeg env configuration in .env for platforms that require auth or merging.
