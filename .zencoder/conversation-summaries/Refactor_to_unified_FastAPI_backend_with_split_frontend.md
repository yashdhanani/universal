## Complete Conversation Summary
The initial task/request: "Continue. You were in the middle of request: soul all quary Avoid repeating steps you've already taken."

We first ran the existing code to establish a baseline. We launched the FastAPI server from the previous implementation (`social_api.py`) on port 8001 and executed `test_social_api.py`. Results showed:
- YouTube info endpoints returned 200 with expected titles; download probes returned 405 on HEAD (typical for CDNs).
- Other platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, TikTok, Twitter) mostly failed due to cookies/geolocation/extractor constraints.

You then requested a clean regeneration and perfecting of the codebase with a clear separation of frontend and backend. We aligned on these decisions:
- Backend: FastAPI only (drop Flask), merging logic into a single service.
- Frontend: Simple static HTML/JS (no build step).
- API routing: Unify under /api/... with backward-compatible legacy routes to avoid breaking consumers.
- Deployment: Keep local venv + Windows start scripts (Docker later if needed).

We implemented a new structure:
- Created backend/app with a unified FastAPI application:
  - Core features: metadata extraction via yt-dlp; format filtering; caching; direct passthrough streaming that is HEAD-aware; merged downloads (video+audio or MP3) via yt-dlp and ffmpeg; consistent routes under /api/{platform}/... and legacy /{platform}/...
  - Backward-compatibility maintained for /{platform}/info and /{platform}/download.
- Created a lightweight frontend (frontend/index.html, style.css, main.js) that calls /api/{platform}/info and /api/{platform}/download.
- Added a convenience script to run the backend with uvicorn (backend/run_backend.ps1).

Files created:
- e:\project\downloader\backend\app\__init__.py
- e:\project\downloader\backend\app\main.py
- e:\project\downloader\backend\run_backend.ps1
- e:\project\downloader\frontend\index.html
- e:\project\downloader\frontend\style.css
- e:\project\downloader\frontend\main.js

Files modified:
- e:\project\downloader\backend\app\main.py (two adjustments to avoid constructing BackgroundTasks at annotation time by defaulting to None in route signatures).

Key technical approaches:
- Unified yt-dlp options (headers, extractor args, env-based ffmpeg/cookies).
- In-memory cache keyed by URL with TTL.
- Passthrough streaming that performs a HEAD first and returns a GET stream with proper headers (Content-Length, Accept-Ranges, Content-Disposition).
- Merged-download functions using temporary directories and background cleanup via BackgroundTasks.
- Route design:
  - /api/{platform}/info
  - /api/{platform}/download
  - /api/{platform}/download_mp3
  - Legacy aliases: /{platform}/info and /{platform}/download
  - /health and /ui

Issues encountered and resolutions:
- PowerShell invocation errors using Python module form were resolved by using the call operator (&) and correct argument ordering.
- Port conflicts (WinError 10048) were resolved by enumerating/stopping existing python/uvicorn processes before relaunching.
- After the refactor, requests to /health and other endpoints returned 500 Internal Server Error. The server starts successfully, but the 500 suggests a runtime error during request handling. Since /health is trivial, this likely indicates a global exception (e.g., import-time, environment, or signature-related) rather than logic within /health. We adjusted endpoint annotations to avoid immediate BackgroundTasks instantiation, but 500s persist and require a quick traceback review (run uvicorn with logging/tracebacks or add minimal logging/middleware) to pinpoint.

Current status and outcomes:
- Repository now split into backend and frontend with a unified FastAPI app and a simple static UI.
- Backward-compatible routes are in place.
- Server launches, but endpoints currently return 500; needs a small follow-up debug to restore successful responses (particularly /health and /{platform}/info). Before refactor, the old server worked for YouTube info; post-refactor functionality should be quickly restorable.

Important insights for future work:
- Add explicit logging and error-handling middleware to capture stack traces (e.g., uvicorn --log-level debug, or FastAPI exception handlers).
- Add integration tests for /health and /api/{platform}/info to catch regressions early.
- Consider optional Docker support for consistent deployment.
- For non-YouTube platforms, cookies/geolocation often required; ensure COOKIES_FILE is set via .env when testing.
- Keep yt-dlp updated and verify ffmpeg availability for merge/MP3 paths.
