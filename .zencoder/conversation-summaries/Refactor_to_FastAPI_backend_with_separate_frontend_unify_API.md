## Complete Conversation Summary
Initial task/request: "Continue. You were in the middle of request: soul all quary. Avoid repeating steps you've already taken."

We first verified the repository context and existing implementation. The project already contained both a Flask app and two FastAPI implementations: a platform-specific FastAPI service (`social_api.py`) exposing routes like /{platform}/info and /{platform}/download, and a more generic `fastapi_app.py` exposing /api-style endpoints.

We successfully ran the existing service (uvicorn social_api:app on 127.0.0.1:8001) and executed the bundled test script (`test_social_api.py`). Results:
- YouTube: /info returned 200 (titles resolved), and probing downloads via stream/HEAD returned 405 (expected for many CDNs).
- Other platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, TikTok, Twitter): Mostly 400s due to cookies/geo/login requirements or extractor behaviorâ€”consistent with real-world constraints.

You requested a clean regeneration and restructuring: FastAPI-only backend, separate frontend and backend, unified API, and correctness. We clarified and locked decisions:
- Backend: FastAPI only (drop Flask).
- Frontend: Simple static HTML/JS (no build step).
- API routing: Unify under /api/... while keeping backward-compatible routes (/youtube/info, etc.).
- Deployment: Keep local venv and Windows start scripts for now.

We then:
- Created a clean structure with backend/ and frontend/ folders.
- Implemented a new unified FastAPI app (backend/app/main.py) featuring:
  - In-memory caching keyed by URL.
  - yt-dlp integration with extractor hints (YouTube android client, skip HLS; language hints; optional cookies via COOKIES_FILE).
  - Unified endpoints:
    - GET /api/{platform}/info: returns normalized metadata with filtered formats.
    - GET /api/{platform}/download: streams a selected format or merges video+audio server-side when required.
    - GET /api/{platform}/download_mp3: extracts MP3 from bestaudio.
  - Backward-compatible routes: GET /{platform}/info and GET /{platform}/download.
  - A minimal UI at GET /ui for quick manual testing.
  - Passthrough streaming that is HEAD-friendly (preflight HEAD to upstream, set Content-Length and Accept-Ranges when available).
  - CORS for common local origins.
- Added a convenience launcher (backend/run_backend.ps1).
- Created a simple frontend (frontend/index.html, style.css, main.js) that calls /api/{platform}/info and links to /api/{platform}/download.

Key technical choices:
- Kept HEAD-friendly streaming for downstream CDNs to mitigate 405s the test encountered.
- Ensured server-side merged downloads use yt-dlp with ffmpeg location from environment variables.
- Avoided brittle defaults by changing BackgroundTasks default arguments from constructed instances to None in endpoints (FastAPI best practice).

Issues encountered and resolutions:
- PowerShell command parsing: Fixed by prefixing Python invocations with & and using absolute paths.
- Port binding conflicts (8001): Resolved by terminating stray Python/uvicorn processes before relaunch.
- After restructuring, the new server started but /health and all routes returned 500. We corrected potentially problematic default parameter values (BackgroundTasks) to None, then restarted. However, /health still returned 500, suggesting a separate runtime error not visible in the captured console. Next step is to capture the stack trace (enable uvicorn --reload --log-level debug or inspect server logs) to pinpoint the exact cause.
- Directory creation: Verified and created backend/ and frontend/ paths after initial listing failure.

Current status and outcomes:
- Original platform-specific FastAPI app (social_api.py) still runs and passes YouTube info tests as before.
- New unified FastAPI app is implemented with clean structure and routes; server starts, but health and info endpoints return 500. Requires a quick traceback to finalize fixes.
- Frontend folder is prepared and wired to unified /api endpoints.
- Test script remains unchanged; backward-compat routes maintained for /{platform}/info and /{platform}/download.

Important insights for future work:
- Many platforms require cookies or region access; rely on COOKIES_FILE for reliability.
- HEAD to third-party CDNs often returns 405; prefer GET streaming with prior HEAD validation when possible.
- Avoid instantiating framework classes (e.g., BackgroundTasks) as default parameters in FastAPI handlers.
- To complete the refactor, enable server debug logs to identify the 500 cause on the new app, then re-run tests. Likely a small startup/route issue.
